# Parallel Dots Data Science Assignment

## Assignment Goal : To find Error/ Differencebetween Groundtruth and Predicted segemnetation of objects using SAM2 

This project requires the following Python libraries:

* **SAM2**
* **TensorFlow:**
* **NumPy:** 
* **Matplotlib:** 
* **OpenCV (cv2):** 
* **Pillow (PIL):** 

## Used SAM2 base model
